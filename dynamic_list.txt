This program will be easier if we divide it into two sub parts.

First one is to add an element to a sequence at a claculated Index.
In formula wise it would be written as : 
Insert y at the end of the ((x XOR lastans) mod n)th sequence.

Secound one is to find the sequence at the calculated index and print the value of calculated SubIndex.
In formula wise it would be :
Print the value of the (y mod size)th element of the ((x XOR lastans) mod n)th sequence.

Here size denotes the size of the related sequence .

An example woud be like, 
n=4, lastans=0, and 1 0 2
It means you have to insert 2 at the calculated index of((0^0)%4).

Time complexity: O(n).
