First we are making an array,counter and size of array is global values.
the adding a constructor class and itializing the values of the above three variables.
then creating a function that appends elemets at the end of the array.Compares if the number of elemets are equal to the size of the array or not.
If count is equal to the size of the array then using grow fuction to dynamically increasing the size of array to accomodate more elements.
If the size of array has space in it then we appends the elements in it.
In grow function we double the size of array.Atfer increasing the size of the array we use a temporary null array to copy the elements of the old array in the new spacious array.
If we want to add  elements at a specific indexes we use addElementsat function to shift the lements to the left from the specified index.
Time Complexity : O(n).
